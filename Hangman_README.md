Python Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. The game is implemented using the Python programming language and can be played in the command line or terminal. The player starts with an empty word, with each letter represented by underscores. As the player suggests letters, the correct guesses will fill in the appropriate spaces in the word. If the player is unable to guess the word before running out of guesses, the game is lost. If the word is successfully guessed, the player wins the game. It can be a fun way to learn python or just pass some time.
